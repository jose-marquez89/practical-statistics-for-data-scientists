# Data and Sampling Distributions
Modern statistics have moved away from assumptions about a population, in
favor of sampling where the assumptions about the underlying distribution
are not necessary.

Data scientists should focus on the sampling procedures and the data right in
front of us, but sometimes you can gain additional insight from knowledge about
the population.

## Random Sampling and Sample bias

**Key Terms: Random Sampling**

**Sample** - a subset of the **population**, which is a larger dataset that is
large and defined, but sometimes imaginary or theoretical.

**N (n)** - the size of the population. Little (n) is used for the sample size

**Random Sampling** - drawing elements into a sample at random

**Stratified Sampling** - dividing the population into _strata_ and randomly
sampling from each strata

**Stratum (pl strata)** - a homogeneous subgroup of a population with common
characteristics.

**Simple Random Sample** - the sample that results from random sampling without
stratifying the population.

**Bias** - systematic error

**Sample Bias** - a sample that misrepresents the population
